# Jumplinks

## Requirements:

- Open the jump links navigation to see the set of links that they can 'jumplink' down to.
- On clicking those links it will anchor the page down to that section.
- The jumplink nav bar should stick to the top of the window when it reaches the top of the browser window
- The jumplink nav bar should unstick once it has reached the end of the jump-linkable sections (you can assume that the jump-linkable sections will always be grouped together).
- The 'active' section should appear in the jumplink nav bar as they scroll.
- The content inside the sections could be anything from text, images, etc (only text is shown in the demo video)
- The user was able to see some visual element that shows their progress through the jumplinkable sections (see blue bar in video as an example).
